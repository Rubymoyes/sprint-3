 - What is your site's primary purpose?

The site's primary purpose will be to showcase the work I have done, my blog posts, and make sure that moving between the blogs and the index page is easy. I want the page to have a smooth and simple feel with 

- Who is your target audience?

Other students and the tutors marking my work. At the moment, I probably wouldn't want other people using my work as an example. Maybe if I had a layout that someone liked and wanted to use it, then that would be a good thing.

- How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want people to feel like they are staying within the same site as they move around the different blog pages and reflections. I definitely want them to not be visually assaulted by colors or have to do lots and lots of reading at once, I would like it to be stress-free and visually pleasing.


- How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I will use the process of building off what I have now, which is a very basic grid and column framework system, and then build it into a more interactive place using CSS with lots of clean lines and a simple layout. I will probably then look at the more intricate stuff like font families, font sizes, backgrounds, images and colors.
